  <h2>his home</h2>

  <p>
    I wonder what it was like for you to move far away from home. Although you really are only gone for a few months at a time. Growing up in a life of rivers and forests and wood-like creatures with trees which held faeries.<br>
    Do you miss drinking the sweet nectar from the maple trees?<br>
    Waiting each spring for the wildflowers to grow.<br>
    Laying on your back watching the clouds?<br>
    Surely nothing here reminds you of home.<br>
    I wonder what it was like to grow up in the outskirts. Amongst flames that flickered with you.<br>
    Did the bears invite you over for tea?<br>
    Surely the bees brought the honey after every harvest.<br>
    Did the birds teach you to sing?<br>
    To be dependent on your own resources.<br>
    ______________<br>
    Did you want to leave?<br>
    To go that far away from home?<br>
    Because truly, it probably is all you have ever known.<br>
    Did you want to go off and make friends with the ocean?<br>
    Oh he’s my dear friend– I can introduce you any time.<br>
    Because this, where you are, is also my home.<br>
    ______________<br>
    I grew up next to the water.<br>
    It was only down the road.<br>
    Not whinding like they portray in movies.<br>
    Just one linear path.<br>
    I’d jump in the ocean no matter the temperature.<br>
    Even if it was so cold, the fish would still be sleeping.<br>
    Where the crabs hidden under the rocks were still shivering.<br>
    Where the birds just wanting to migrate home were still weeping.<br>
    This is my home.<br>
    But it is not all I’ve ever known.<br>
    ______________<br>
    The Northeast is where I’m really from.<br>
    Though not the part where there are lumberjacks who only drink rum.<br>
    I was also near the sea.<br>
    Seems as if it’s always followed me.<br>
    With foliage as orange and as deep as a monarch, just beginning to spread its wings.<br>
    There’s a vineyard off the tail of Massachusetts.<br>
    With gingerbread houses and a small town square.<br>
    Where the watchmakers knew the bakers,<br>
    And the whales knew the hares.<br>
    The clam chowder was as mushy as a beaten pumpkin,<br>
    And tasted like home.<br>
    Real home.<br>
    ______________<br>
    Now I wonder if our lives were any at all parallel.<br>
    Though growing up in different places.<br>
    You likely never saw any new faces,<br>
    While I would easily lose my way through the large market places.<br>
    ~But just maybe in the spring,<br>
    While you waited for the flowers to grow,<br>
    I also was waiting,<br>
    But for the rain to slowly go.<br>
    And maybe in the summer,<br>
    While you called out “I’ll be home by sundown, mother”,<br>
    I was muttering at the ocean saying,<br>
    “Just one more wave, please give me another”.<br>
    Perhaps in the autumn,<br>
    You were celebrating the death of the now orange leaves fall.<br>
    While I was also cheering,<br>
    For another year of growing tall.<br>
    Finally in the winter,<br>
    We would both run home,<br>
    After a day of Christmas shopping,<br>
    With or without snow.<br>
    Throw on a sweater, sit on the couch.<br>
    Watch a movie with the family,<br>
    “This, is what it’s all about”.<br>
    Seeing cousins from near and far<br>
    Being safe at home,<br>
    Because that really, is all humans should ever know.<br>
    ______________<br>
    Now that our paths have crossed,<br>
    I wonder if it will be significant.<br>
    Or if we will forever be two strangers<br>
    Talking, but from a distance.<br>
    Because you really, do not know me.<br>
    And neither do I know you,<br>
    This paper is just simply what I perceive,<br>
    And only time, will tell the truth.

    <h2>Initial Introduction</h2>
    <div class="date"></div>
    <p>I've been writing since as long as I can remember. In journals, in margins of books, school notes, on desks, on walls, etc. This is a place where I can store all of them because the digital footprints never go away. All my writings are crammed in places I can sometimes not remember so here they are now... Hopefully forever.</p>
