  <h1>some writings</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <h2>initial introduction</h2>
    <div class="date">10:42am; July 16th, 2025</div>
    <p>I close my eyes and think of my first dorm room.<br>
Falling asleep every night staring at my 8x11 cutout rectangle from a roll of scratch paper.<br>
I'd use that scratch paper to do homework over and over again because it was the only thing that I had thought mattered.<br>
It's blurry in my dream but in my mind I can still see it so clearly.<br>
My Life Plan, it says at the top of the paper, with five bulletpoints below it.<br>
Get my doctorate, move somewhere in Europe, work for a big company.<br>
Maybe even build my own company.<br>
I open my eyes and look around my room now, three years later.<br>
It's cluttered with postcards from places I've been.<br>
With photos of friends who I never could have dreamed of having.<br>
Little writings torn out from class notebooks.<br>
Parking stamps and trinkets to remember days I spent laughing with loved ones.<br>
Everybody always says that good things take time, and I now believe it.<br>
It's taken twenty-one years for me to understand that there's more to life than awards and accolades.<br>
There's love and stories and big and small moments in between.<br>
I hope that one day int he future when I open my eyes again,<br>
I will see a dog running around in my big backyard during sunset,<br>
with someone I love, and a reflection of me at five years old chasing the birds.<br>
That is all I could want.<br>
All that I could ever need.<br>
All that I can think of and all that I am is all that I have ever loved.<br>

  <h2>first final week</h2>
  <div class="date">11:38am; April 28th, 2023</div>
  <p>
  The girl had the type of week that all teenage girls dread. She looked at herself in the mirror and felt her eyes sinking in, her body feeling puffy, and her clothes seeming ill fitting.<br>
    Maybe these physical issues were just distractions from everything else.<br>
    She felt lonely, but she didn’t know why.<br>
    Maybe that’s why she grew up with her biggest fear of being lonely.<br>
    It was because she’d be left alone in her own thoughts.<br>
    She felt that one day it might be too late to go back.<br>
    That one day she’ll wake up and sit on her bed,<br>
    With her book on the nightstand with her glasses on top.<br>
    With a cold tea cup still three quarters full.<br>
    And she’ll go to open her blinds and watch as the light seeps into her room,<br>
    Covering every inch with sun.<br>
    But as she goes back to open her novel, she’ll realize all that’s ever been in her head.<br><br>

  Realizing that maybe the friends she had at school were part of her imagination.<br>
    Realizing that maybe she only read books to feel smart like her peers.<br>
    Realizing that maybe she only drinks tea to try and act the age of everyone else on campus.<br>
    Realizing that maybe she didn’t fear being lonely, but the fear of others knowing that she was lonely.<br><br>

   Maybe that was why the boy in math class caught her eye. The one who tries to hold in his laugh.<br>
    Everyday she would wake up and envision her day being confident and effortlessly bright.<br>
    But no matter how much she replayed these scenarios in her mind, it rarely ever went that way.<br>
    He was different though.<br>
    He seemed okay with being alone.. Sometimes it seemed like he liked it.<br>
    Just to be him in the corners of the room.<br>
    He could be dancing in a daydream,<br>
    Or carrying the weight of the world.<br>
    That’s how she thought his mind was working.<br>
    And then one day, she walked past him sitting at the grand old brown tree table.<br>
    She walked past so quickly. It was like the wind was carrying her.<br>
    She stood behind the bathroom door, preparing herself for what was on the other side.<br>
    Reading that, one may think that she’s talking about ogres or big bears.<br>
    But instead it was people.<br>
    Just people.<br>
    She took a deep breath and walked back out. She sat down and she knew that he saw her.<br>
    Her mind was buzzing until she opened her mouth and started speaking. She didn’t look at him however.<br>
    The boy put down his work and began to speak. It was so easy.<br>
    They discussed their Easter festivities and their mathematics examination.<br>
    She had talked to him twice prior, but this time it was different.<br>
    She felt deep down that they should be friends.<br>
    So friends is what they became.<br><br>

  There were less than 48 hours left in her first year at university.<br>
    Now how was she going to spend her final hours there?<br>
    One option was to stay inside her dormitory, close the curtains and have the only light be from her lamp to only write.<br>
    Write about how her year had gone, how life was going to go in the way it was.<br>
    Read her journal from her first year. The most emotional journal of all.<br>
    She planned to reflect in silence and solitude.<br>
    But then sitting in the library made her realize something.<br>
    Her first year wasn’t over just yet.<br>
    She had one last task she wanted to complete.<br>
    After all her to-do lists she completed, and all her to-do lists that she didn’t complete,<br>
    The one final task was: to deliver a book.<br>
    Not just any book, her book.<br>
    Her own copy of a Hemmingway novel.<br>
    It was more than 200 pages bound together by a paper cover,<br>
    But her way of saying goodbye and how although they were acquaintances at most,<br>
    He meant something to her.<br>
    And she could only hope that she meant something to him too.<br>
    She hoped that she meant enough for him not to forget her that summer.<br>

  <h2>his home</h2>
  <div class="date">9:54am; November 5th, 2022</div>
  <p>
    I wonder what it was like for you to move far away from home. Although you really are only gone for a few months at a time. Growing up in a life of rivers and forests and wood-like creatures with trees which held faeries.<br>
    Do you miss drinking the sweet nectar from the maple trees?<br>
    Waiting each spring for the wildflowers to grow.<br>
    Laying on your back watching the clouds?<br>
    Surely nothing here reminds you of home.<br>
    I wonder what it was like to grow up in the outskirts. Amongst flames that flickered with you.<br>
    Did the bears invite you over for tea?<br>
    Surely the bees brought the honey after every harvest.<br>
    Did the birds teach you to sing?<br>
    To be dependent on your own resources.<br>
    ______________<br>
    Did you want to leave?<br>
    To go that far away from home?<br>
    Because truly, it probably is all you have ever known.<br>
    Did you want to go off and make friends with the ocean?<br>
    Oh he’s my dear friend– I can introduce you any time.<br>
    Because this, where you are, is also my home.<br>
    ______________<br>
    I grew up next to the water.<br>
    It was only down the road.<br>
    Not whinding like they portray in movies.<br>
    Just one linear path.<br>
    I’d jump in the ocean no matter the temperature.<br>
    Even if it was so cold, the fish would still be sleeping.<br>
    Where the crabs hidden under the rocks were still shivering.<br>
    Where the birds just wanting to migrate home were still weeping.<br>
    This is my home.<br>
    But it is not all I’ve ever known.<br>
    ______________<br>
    The Northeast is where I’m really from.<br>
    Though not the part where there are lumberjacks who only drink rum.<br>
    I was also near the sea.<br>
    Seems as if it’s always followed me.<br>
    With foliage as orange and as deep as a monarch, just beginning to spread its wings.<br>
    There’s a vineyard off the tail of Massachusetts.<br>
    With gingerbread houses and a small town square.<br>
    Where the watchmakers knew the bakers,<br>
    And the whales knew the hares.<br>
    The clam chowder was as mushy as a beaten pumpkin,<br>
    And tasted like home.<br>
    Real home.<br>
    ______________<br>
    Now I wonder if our lives were any at all parallel.<br>
    Though growing up in different places.<br>
    You likely never saw any new faces,<br>
    While I would easily lose my way through the large market places.<br>
    ~But just maybe in the spring,<br>
    While you waited for the flowers to grow,<br>
    I also was waiting,<br>
    But for the rain to slowly go.<br>
    And maybe in the summer,<br>
    While you called out “I’ll be home by sundown, mother”,<br>
    I was muttering at the ocean saying,<br>
    “Just one more wave, please give me another”.<br>
    Perhaps in the autumn,<br>
    You were celebrating the death of the now orange leaves fall.<br>
    While I was also cheering,<br>
    For another year of growing tall.<br>
    Finally in the winter,<br>
    We would both run home,<br>
    After a day of Christmas shopping,<br>
    With or without snow.<br>
    Throw on a sweater, sit on the couch.<br>
    Watch a movie with the family,<br>
    “This, is what it’s all about”.<br>
    Seeing cousins from near and far<br>
    Being safe at home,<br>
    Because that really, is all humans should ever know.<br>
    ______________<br>
    Now that our paths have crossed,<br>
    I wonder if it will be significant.<br>
    Or if we will forever be two strangers<br>
    Talking, but from a distance.<br>
    Because you really, do not know me.<br>
    And neither do I know you,<br>
    This paper is just simply what I perceive,<br>
    And only time, will tell the truth.

    <p>I've been writing since as long as I can remember. In journals, in margins of books, school notes, on desks, on walls, etc. This is a place where I can store all of them because the digital footprints never go away. All my writings are crammed in places I can sometimes not remember so here they are now... Hopefully forever.</p>
