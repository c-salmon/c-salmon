  <h1>some writings</h1>

    <h2>initial introduction</h2>
    <div class="date"></div>
    <p>I've been writing since as long as I can remember. In journals, in margins of books, school notes, on desks, on walls, etc. This is a place where I can store all of them because the digital footprints never go away. All my writings are crammed in places I can sometimes not remember so here they are now... Hopefully forever.</p>

    <h2>ebb</h2>
    <div class="date"></div>
    <p>
It was my last day staring at the Atlantic.<br>
The ebb and flow of the water inched towards my feet;<br>
It was a mix of blues and greens.<br>
The colors made an emerald hue reminiscent of the inner specks of your eyes.<br>
I kissed goodbye to the waters that had held me for two short days.<br>
The same waters that coddled you for two long decades.<br>
We drove back to your house.<br>
The floorboards beneath my feet squeaked as I lugged my suitcase up the stairs.<br>
I tried to listen to them.<br>
Each creak as if they were whispers.<br>
I thought to myself how these planks of wood would always know more of your secrets than I ever will..<br>
As I sat on the footstool waiting for you to finish showering,<br>
the humid summer air seeped through the window.<br>
The whirring of the breeze harmonized with the air conditioner.<br>
I tried to listen to it.<br>
Every note sounding part of a goodbye hymn as I knew I would soon leave Massachusetts,<br>
And leave the thought of you behind with it.<br>
The bathroom door opened and I was greeted with a cloud of steam.<br>
Now all I could hear was the water dripping on the tiles.<br>
You're whistling a song I will never be able to name.<br>
I’m falling asleep as the clock strikes three in the morning.<br>
I don’t know what exactly I was trying to listen for that night.<br>
Maybe a reason to stay, or a reason to go.<br>
The last sounds I heard as I dozed off to bed was you saying goodnight,<br>
as the sound of the Cape Cod waves drifted back to me.<br>
It ebbed towards the both of us, then took you back out to sea with it.<br>
Leaving me here,<br>
As I try to keep listening for something,<br>
anything,<br>
every night since then.<br>

    <h2>etched in wood</h2>
    <div class="date">10:03pm; March 7th, 2025 (Written on the plane ride heading home from Scotland)</div>
    <p>Jacob and the Stone just started playing. When it does, I think about a future which will not happen- but is nice to think about. Suddenly as I close my eyes, I go to “another life”, although I secretly hope it’s this one. 

It entails a house on Cape Cod. One that’s a little beaten on the outside- but it’s okay because the inside is full of love. It’s filled with books. Some new ones which present me does not even know about yet- though the future me living in this alternate reality would call them “my favorites”. Along these shelves would have familiar favorites like Tuesdays with Morrie and All the Light We Cannot See. They’re no longer new but the inside still has the Warwick’s receipt from ages ago now. Girard Street, the bookstore across the bakery with heart shaped cookies. San Diego feels like a long time ago now. Their spines are now cracked and peeling like the white paint along the kitchen doorframe where there are markings etched on.  “Margot: 4 years”, “James: 5 years”, “James: 6 1/2 years”…but that time written with the handwriting of.. I’m guessing, a 6 1/2 year old. I follow the long shelf of books and it  would soon lead me into an office. The office is overlooking a lighthouse in the very distance that I knew I could only see when the skies are clear. Otherwise, the view would just be tall grass and a vast grey ocean. The office has the old teacher’s desk with the length and width comparable to a coffin made for a grizzly bear. Brown and chipped with old markings carved into it. “J” and a smiley face among others. <br>

Above the desk are old papers of problem sets from a decade ago now. I look at them and could still remember the dusty smell of the physics hallway in the Sacred Heart Wing of the big building at the west of the campus called the “Jewel on the Hill”. On every other pushpin holding up the now yellowed papers scribbled with equations have photos in front of them. Ones from bars and sunsets on the beach with a grown up version of the boy who would carve the letter “J” into any piece of wood he could with his Swiss Army knife, which he got for Christmas when he was 11. Maybe the photos were in front of the awards and dissertations because I felt that they, at the end, were more important than the applause I got during my academic career- or maybe it was just because I ran out of pushpins. I never had enough in my college dorm, and seemingly still don’t have enough in my family’s home. Oh yes, my family. <br>

I hear footsteps running down the hall and I see a little girl with a boy only slightly taller than her. It’s odd because I can’t see their faces, but I can see the girl’s two brown braids, and the boy’s wind swept hair. I only see them run past the office door for a split second and hear their laughter. I don’t necessarily know them, but I could feel inside that I had been waiting all my life to meet them. I don’t know their favorite foods yet but I know that they’re enrolled in the suburb’s youth soccer team. I don’t know their favorite bedtime stories yet but I know that soccer practice consists more of peeling oranges for them than watching them score goals. And really, that’s fine by me. <br>

I follow the sound of clattering pots and pans and make my way into the hallway where there are more photos hung up. This time in actual frames. They’re mix matched and is evident they were found at goodwills. There’s old photos and new photos. Grey photos and colored photos. Solo photos and group photos. There are two side by side that catch my eye. One in an old kids-made frame with little fingerprints on bottom right hand corner with a picture of a little boy in the North End city of Boston in front of a Mike’s Pastry. The boy looks familiar- and his hair looks a bit wind swept too. Next to it is another picture in the same part of town, just next to Fenway a couple blocks down from the pastry shop. This time it’s a little girl with black hair and pink circular glasses- she looks familiar too. Maybe it was the eyes or maybe it was the little braids. The photos continuing down the hallway have the same parallel photos of this little boy and little girl up until elementary school. They no longer have the parallel theme, as the girl’s photos are now in front of palm trees and the boy’s in a tree filled suburb with what looks like a Swiss Army knife poking out from his pocket. <br>

I reach the end of the photo wall and begin to smell something familiar- my favorite pasta. I had been going to various Italian restaurants since trying it for the first time at age 21. However, none of the fancy restaurants that seat you with two sets of forks and spoons could compare to the homemade pasta that was made that one Sunday night on the granite of a college dorm’s kitchen. Only this smell lingering throughout the lived in walls could compare. I see a man with a red apron tasting a sauce as I walk towards the breakfast nook. Next to the clock I see one last picture frame hung up, and it’s of a wedding taking place at a church I’ve driven past dozens and hundreds of times. I take a closer look and notice it’s where I was baptized as a baby, Saint Therese’s church. Perfectly situated between Chestnut Hill and Milton. On the corner of this frame is one last carving. It’s no surprise that there’s a “J”, but this time next to it, there’s also a “+ C”. <br>

I hear a voice saying that dinner’s ready. As this is said I hear the footsteps from earlier running towards me with the same laughter. Although it sounded like the laughter was getting closer, it suddenly started fading away along with the sound of the Atlantic Ocean ebbing on the sand.. and the smell of pasta drifted away as Jacob and the Stone ended. <br>

It was then that I opened my eyes and found myself staring at my hands which I knew would one day hold my orange eating children, turn the key to my family’s home, and grasp the pen when I write in my ninth or tenth journal that I had finally made it. </p>

    <h2>black pants</h2>
    <div class="date">Sometime in the evening; March 31, 2025</div>
    <p>
Today I was looking around the room and had nowhere to put my hands<br>
I looked at the people near me and across from me working on math problems.<br>
My hands wandered to the fabric of my black pants while I stared at my shoes.<br>
I felt a part of the fabric scratched with a slight pilling.<br>
I thought about for a moment where it had come from.<br>
I stared at my shoes some more.<br>
It then occurred to me the day that my pants got ripped in shrubs.<br>
It was the same day that the mud stained my shoes.<br>
The same day my blue jacket couldn’t keep me warm enough.<br>
The day that your cheeks turned a bright shade of red and mine a lighter shade of pink from the New England winds.<br>
The day I watched as you chased your dog around grass with a smile of a child.<br>
The day I stepped into your childhood bedroom and saw your life culminated into one space.<br>
Clusters of stick on stars on the ceiling that you once stared at while drifting into a dream of being grown.<br>
A mirror you watched yourself comb your brown hair in before your middle school dance.<br>
The one window you’ve looked out of countless times to see if it was snowing.<br>
And the door that you shut one last time before leaving for college.<br>
This was all seen the day I met your mother, in the living room where you’ve opened Christmas gifts for 22 years.<br>
Next to the kitchen where you would watch her make your favorite chicken and rice.<br>
In the house big enough for you and your sister to grow up in,<br>
and for your two parents to grow old in. <br>
As I said goodbye to the place which once held you in your youth, I looked at the front door.<br>
The front door where you sat while your dad tied your shoes for soccer practice.<br>
Where you would put your muddy shoes in front of to not dirty the house.<br>
And now, it was me putting on my muddy shoes to leave.<br>
As we drove away, the sun was setting and so was the time we would spend together in your hometown.<br>
We made the three turns.<br>
Left, right, left.<br>
It was all on the same day that I realized how lucky I was that we both met, somehow, someday, on a warm February night, all those months ago.<br>
And how every moment since I had my first memory of Boston and you, had led me to where I am with you now.<br>
My eyes focused back on my shoes.<br>
I looked up and realized everyone was still working on their math problem,<br>
All while I was still thinking of you.<br>

    <h2>an unknown red string</h2>
    <div class="date">1:29pm; October 30th, 2024</div>
    <p>There was a girl who wore glasses and was seemingly studious in class.<br>
Her jam jar glasses fogged up when she would rush to class.<br>
She felt that she had some people then nobody in spans of hours.<br>
She spent her weekends alone or at home with her parents.<br>
Watching ball games with her father or getting groceries with her mom.<br>
She knew another world of university was out there but didn’t feel as if she’d ever choose it.<br>
She then realized however that maybe it was that world not choosing her.<br>
Days passed and she got enveloped and wrapped around something else, someone else.<br>
It felt like she was suffocating but at the same time with something so warm and tender to where she never wanted to leave.<br>
However, the red yarn started unraveling and soon she was left with just herself again..<br>
Navigating how to be alone with herself, once again.<br>
She went to Spain and tried to only think of herself for once on the flight.<br> <br>
3400 miles away, there was a boy packing a duffel bag getting ready to go back to school out west.<br>
He went into his car and waited for the car to warm up.<br>

    <h2>the cape</h2>
    <div class="date">3:43pm; July 6th, 2025 (Written on sand of Bank Street Beach, Massachusetts)
</div>
    <p>And as I sat on the ocean of Cape Cod with the wind blowing strongly in my ears , I looked at the Atlantic and knew that this would probably be the last time for a while that I feel its kisses as the waves brush ashore, and the whispers of the breeze blowing gently across my skin.<br>
and as my hair dries in the sun,<br>
my time here keeps slipping.<br>
And as I see the seagulls leaving, flying across the blue sky,<br>
I know that this is it.<br>
This whole thing feels like one great goodbye,<br>
because I don't know when I will be here next.<br>
I don't know when I'll see his family next,<br>
and this might just be one of the last times.<br> <br>
And now Massachusetts is all you-<br>
though my father and my family's blood was raised here,<br>
though my eyes first opened here.<br>
Everytime I open my eyes here now, twenty one years later,<br>
all I see is you around me.<br> <br>
And I know that both of us, even together, are not stronger than distance and time.<br>
Everything that I ever possibly thought that I could love is here,<br>
and I'll miss it so.<br>
But every time I hear this breeze, I'll always think of the cottage on the sea.<br>
It all just feels like one big goodbye.<br>
</p>

    <h2>my first dorm</h2>
    <div class="date">10:42am; July 16th, 2025</div>
    <p>I close my eyes and think of my first dorm room.<br>
Falling asleep every night staring at my 8x11 cutout rectangle from a roll of scratch paper.<br>
I'd use that scratch paper to do homework over and over again because it was the only thing that I had thought mattered.<br>
It's blurry in my dream but in my mind I can still see it so clearly.<br>
My Life Plan, it says at the top of the paper, with five bulletpoints below it.<br>
Get my doctorate, move somewhere in Europe, work for a big company.<br>
Maybe even build my own company.<br>
I open my eyes and look around my room now, three years later.<br>
It's cluttered with postcards from places I've been.<br>
With photos of friends who I never could have dreamed of having.<br>
Little writings torn out from class notebooks.<br>
Parking stamps and trinkets to remember days I spent laughing with loved ones.<br>
Everybody always says that good things take time, and I now believe it.<br>
It's taken twenty-one years for me to understand that there's more to life than awards and accolades.<br>
There's love and stories and big and small moments in between.<br>
I hope that one day int he future when I open my eyes again,<br>
I will see a dog running around in my big backyard during sunset,<br>
with someone I love, and a reflection of me at five years old chasing the birds.<br>
That is all I could want.<br>
All that I could ever need.<br>
All that I can think of and all that I am is all that I have ever loved.<br>

  <h2>first final week</h2>
  <div class="date">11:38am; April 28th, 2023</div>
  <p>
  The girl had the type of week that all teenage girls dread. She looked at herself in the mirror and felt her eyes sinking in, her body feeling puffy, and her clothes seeming ill fitting.<br>
    Maybe these physical issues were just distractions from everything else.<br>
    She felt lonely, but she didn’t know why.<br>
    Maybe that’s why she grew up with her biggest fear of being lonely.<br>
    It was because she’d be left alone in her own thoughts.<br>
    She felt that one day it might be too late to go back.<br>
    That one day she’ll wake up and sit on her bed,<br>
    With her book on the nightstand with her glasses on top.<br>
    With a cold tea cup still three quarters full.<br>
    And she’ll go to open her blinds and watch as the light seeps into her room,<br>
    Covering every inch with sun.<br>
    But as she goes back to open her novel, she’ll realize all that’s ever been in her head.<br><br>

  Realizing that maybe the friends she had at school were part of her imagination.<br>
    Realizing that maybe she only read books to feel smart like her peers.<br>
    Realizing that maybe she only drinks tea to try and act the age of everyone else on campus.<br>
    Realizing that maybe she didn’t fear being lonely, but the fear of others knowing that she was lonely.<br><br>

   Maybe that was why the boy in math class caught her eye. The one who tries to hold in his laugh.<br>
    Everyday she would wake up and envision her day being confident and effortlessly bright.<br>
    But no matter how much she replayed these scenarios in her mind, it rarely ever went that way.<br>
    He was different though.<br>
    He seemed okay with being alone.. Sometimes it seemed like he liked it.<br>
    Just to be him in the corners of the room.<br>
    He could be dancing in a daydream,<br>
    Or carrying the weight of the world.<br>
    That’s how she thought his mind was working.<br>
    And then one day, she walked past him sitting at the grand old brown tree table.<br>
    She walked past so quickly. It was like the wind was carrying her.<br>
    She stood behind the bathroom door, preparing herself for what was on the other side.<br>
    Reading that, one may think that she’s talking about ogres or big bears.<br>
    But instead it was people.<br>
    Just people.<br>
    She took a deep breath and walked back out. She sat down and she knew that he saw her.<br>
    Her mind was buzzing until she opened her mouth and started speaking. She didn’t look at him however.<br>
    The boy put down his work and began to speak. It was so easy.<br>
    They discussed their Easter festivities and their mathematics examination.<br>
    She had talked to him twice prior, but this time it was different.<br>
    She felt deep down that they should be friends.<br>
    So friends is what they became.<br><br>

  There were less than 48 hours left in her first year at university.<br>
    Now how was she going to spend her final hours there?<br>
    One option was to stay inside her dormitory, close the curtains and have the only light be from her lamp to only write.<br>
    Write about how her year had gone, how life was going to go in the way it was.<br>
    Read her journal from her first year. The most emotional journal of all.<br>
    She planned to reflect in silence and solitude.<br>
    But then sitting in the library made her realize something.<br>
    Her first year wasn’t over just yet.<br>
    She had one last task she wanted to complete.<br>
    After all her to-do lists she completed, and all her to-do lists that she didn’t complete,<br>
    The one final task was: to deliver a book.<br>
    Not just any book, her book.<br>
    Her own copy of a Hemmingway novel.<br>
    It was less than 200 pages bound together by a paper cover,<br>
    But it was her way of saying goodbye and how although they were acquaintances at most,<br>
    He meant something to her.<br>
    And she could only hope that she meant something to him too.<br>
    She hoped that she meant enough for him not to forget her that summer.<br>

  <h2>his home</h2>
  <div class="date">9:54am; November 5th, 2022</div>
  <p>
    I wonder what it was like for you to move far away from home. Although you really are only gone for a few months at a time. Growing up in a life of rivers and forests and wood-like creatures with trees which held faeries.<br>
    Do you miss drinking the sweet nectar from the maple trees?<br>
    Waiting each spring for the wildflowers to grow.<br>
    Laying on your back watching the clouds?<br>
    Surely nothing here reminds you of home.<br>
    I wonder what it was like to grow up in the outskirts. Amongst flames that flickered with you.<br>
    Did the bears invite you over for tea?<br>
    Surely the bees brought the honey after every harvest.<br>
    Did the birds teach you to sing?<br>
    To be dependent on your own resources.<br>
    ______________<br>
    Did you want to leave?<br>
    To go that far away from home?<br>
    Because truly, it probably is all you have ever known.<br>
    Did you want to go off and make friends with the ocean?<br>
    Oh he’s my dear friend– I can introduce you any time.<br>
    Because this, where you are, is also my home.<br>
    ______________<br>
    I grew up next to the water.<br>
    It was only down the road.<br>
    Not whinding like they portray in movies.<br>
    Just one linear path.<br>
    I’d jump in the ocean no matter the temperature.<br>
    Even if it was so cold, the fish would still be sleeping.<br>
    Where the crabs hidden under the rocks were still shivering.<br>
    Where the birds just wanting to migrate home were still weeping.<br>
    This is my home.<br>
    But it is not all I’ve ever known.<br>
    ______________<br>
    The Northeast is where I’m really from.<br>
    Though not the part where there are lumberjacks who only drink rum.<br>
    I was also near the sea.<br>
    Seems as if it’s always followed me.<br>
    With foliage as orange and as deep as a monarch, just beginning to spread its wings.<br>
    There’s a vineyard off the tail of Massachusetts.<br>
    With gingerbread houses and a small town square.<br>
    Where the watchmakers knew the bakers,<br>
    And the whales knew the hares.<br>
    The clam chowder was as mushy as a beaten pumpkin,<br>
    And tasted like home.<br>
    Real home.<br>
    ______________<br>
    Now I wonder if our lives were any at all parallel.<br>
    Though growing up in different places.<br>
    You likely never saw any new faces,<br>
    While I would easily lose my way through the large market places.<br>
    ~But just maybe in the spring,<br>
    While you waited for the flowers to grow,<br>
    I also was waiting,<br>
    But for the rain to slowly go.<br>
    And maybe in the summer,<br>
    While you called out “I’ll be home by sundown, mother”,<br>
    I was muttering at the ocean saying,<br>
    “Just one more wave, please give me another”.<br>
    Perhaps in the autumn,<br>
    You were celebrating the death of the now orange leaves fall.<br>
    While I was also cheering,<br>
    For another year of growing tall.<br>
    Finally in the winter,<br>
    We would both run home,<br>
    After a day of Christmas shopping,<br>
    With or without snow.<br>
    Throw on a sweater, sit on the couch.<br>
    Watch a movie with the family,<br>
    “This, is what it’s all about”.<br>
    Seeing cousins from near and far<br>
    Being safe at home,<br>
    Because that really, is all humans should ever know.<br>
    ______________<br>
    Now that our paths have crossed,<br>
    I wonder if it will be significant.<br>
    Or if we will forever be two strangers<br>
    Talking, but from a distance.<br>
    Because you really, do not know me.<br>
    And neither do I know you,<br>
    This paper is just simply what I perceive,<br>
    And only time, will tell the truth.
